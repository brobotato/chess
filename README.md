#Chess

This is a modded version of chess in pygame for ICS60 at UCI.

---

The rules are the same as normal chess, except when a piece (excluding the King) captures a piece it upgrades.

The upgrade path is as follows:

Pawn -> Knight -> Bishop -> Rook -> Queen -> Pawn 
	
As a note, if a queen captures a piece in the last row of the enemyâ€™s side, it becomes a pawn as opposed to promoting to a queen.
